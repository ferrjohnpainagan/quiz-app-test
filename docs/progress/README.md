## Reports

### [001 - Foundation and Core Architecture](./001-foundation-and-core-architecture.md)

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** âœ… Complete

**Topics Covered:**

- Type system architecture with discriminated unions
- Security-first API design (client/server type separation)
- Hono backend framework setup
- Component architecture with router/factory pattern
- Mock data layer implementation
- Initial state management approach

**Key Decisions:**

- Using Hono for better type inference and DX
- Separating `ClientQuestion` and `Question` types for security
- Router pattern for question component rendering
- Local state for MVP (Zustand planned for later)

## How to Use These Docs

### For Development Continuity

When resuming work, read the most recent report to understand:

- What was built and why
- What's missing and what's next
- Technical debt and improvement opportunities
- Architectural patterns in use

### For Code Reviews

Use these reports to understand the reasoning behind implementation choices. Each report links to relevant files and line numbers.

## Report Structure

Each progress report follows this template:

1. **Overview** - High-level summary of the phase
2. **What Was Built** - Detailed breakdown of implementations
3. **Key Decisions** - Technical choices and rationale
4. **Architecture Diagram** - Visual representation of the system
5. **Technology Stack Rationale** - Why each tool was chosen
6. **Key Learnings** - What worked, what didn't, what to improve

## Contributing to Progress Docs

When creating a new progress report:

1. **Use sequential numbering** - `00X-descriptive-name.md`
2. **Include the date** - Document when the work was completed
3. **Link to code** - Use relative paths to reference files
4. **Explain trade-offs** - Document what was sacrificed and why
5. **Be honest** - Include what didn't work and lessons learned
6. **Update this README** - Add your report to the list above
