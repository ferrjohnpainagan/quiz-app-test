## Reports

### [001 - Foundation and Core Architecture](./001-foundation-and-core-architecture.md)

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Topics Covered:**

- Type system architecture with discriminated unions
- Security-first API design (client/server type separation)
- Hono backend framework setup
- Component architecture with router/factory pattern
- Mock data layer implementation
- Initial state management approach

**Key Decisions:**

- Using Hono for better type inference and DX
- Separating `ClientQuestion` and `Question` types for security
- Router pattern for question component rendering
- Local state for MVP (Zustand planned for later)

### [002 - Grading System and Results](./002-grading-system-and-results.md)
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Topics Covered:**
- Zod validation schemas for runtime type safety
- Pure grading functions for each question type
- POST /api/grade endpoint implementation
- Quiz submission flow and state management
- Results page with per-question feedback
- Error handling strategies (400 vs 500)

**Key Decisions:**
- Zod for runtime validation with type inference
- Separate pure functions per question type (testability)
- Sorted array comparison for checkbox order-independence
- SessionStorage for results (pragmatic simplicity)
- All-or-nothing grading for checkboxes (clarity over complexity)

---

### [003 - Testing and Security](./003-testing-and-security.md)
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Topics Covered:**
- Comprehensive test suite (51 tests, 100% pass rate)
- Unit tests for grading logic (25 tests)
- Security validation tests (26 tests)
- XSS prevention with input sanitization
- DoS protection with length limits
- Type confusion prevention
- Bounds checking and edge case coverage

**Key Decisions:**
- Vitest for fast test execution (<1 second)
- Multi-layer security validation (Zod + business logic + type guards)
- XSS sanitization via angle bracket removal
- Security constants for centralized limits
- Pure function testing for speed and simplicity

---

### [004 - State Management and Timer](./004-state-management-and-timer.md)
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**Topics Covered:**
- Zustand global state management implementation
- Timer system with Unix timestamps
- Quiz session persistence with localStorage
- Auto-submission on time expiration
- Progressive timer urgency (visual warnings)
- Confirmation modals for critical actions
- Session guards and navigation protection

**Key Decisions:**
- Zustand for global state (eliminated prop drilling)
- persist middleware for automatic localStorage sync
- Partial state persistence (only quiz data, not UI states)
- Timestamp-based timer calculation (prevents drift)
- Auto-submit on timer expiration (guarantees completion)
- Progressive visual urgency (color changes at 60s and 30s)

## How to Use These Docs

### For Development Continuity

When resuming work, read the most recent report to understand:

- What was built and why
- What's missing and what's next
- Technical debt and improvement opportunities
- Architectural patterns in use

### For Code Reviews

Use these reports to understand the reasoning behind implementation choices. Each report links to relevant files and line numbers.

## Report Structure

Each progress report follows this template:

1. **Overview** - High-level summary of the phase
2. **What Was Built** - Detailed breakdown of implementations
3. **Key Decisions** - Technical choices and rationale
4. **Architecture Diagram** - Visual representation of the system
5. **Technology Stack Rationale** - Why each tool was chosen
6. **Key Learnings** - What worked, what didn't, what to improve

---

## Contributing to Progress Docs

When creating a new progress report:

1. **Use sequential numbering** - `00X-descriptive-name.md`
2. **Include the date** - Document when the work was completed
3. **Link to code** - Use relative paths to reference files
4. **Explain trade-offs** - Document what was sacrificed and why
5. **Be honest** - Include what didn't work and lessons learned
6. **Update this README** - Add your report to the list above
